## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the architecture and data flow of the E-Commerce App. The app is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to browse products, view details, and make purchases efficiently.

## Architecture

### Overview
The E-Commerce App is built using the Flutter framework, following a clean architecture approach. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the application more modular, maintainable, and testable. The application is divided into three main layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.

### Layers

#### Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer is responsible for the user interface and user interactions. It includes Flutter widgets that render the UI and handle user inputs. The main components of this layer are:
- Screens (e.g., Home Screen, Product Details Screen)
- Widgets (e.g., Product Card, App Bar)
- State Management (using providers or any state management solution)

#### Domain Layer
The Domain Layer contains the business logic of the application. It defines the core entities, use cases, and repository interfaces. This layer is independent of any external frameworks and focuses on the applicationâ€™s rules. Key components include:
- **Entities**: Core data models (e.g., `Product`, `User`)
- **Use Cases**: Business logic implementations (e.g., `GetAllProducts`, `UpdateProduct`)
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data operations (e.g., `ECommerceRepository`)

#### Data Layer
The Data Layer handles data storage and retrieval. It includes data sources such as APIs, databases, and local storage. This layer is responsible for implementing the repository interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. Components include:
- **Models**: Data models that map to the entities (e.g., `ProductModel`)
- **Data Sources**: API clients and local storage mechanisms (e.g., `RemoteDataSource`, `LocalDataSource`)
- **Repository Implementations**: Classes that implement the repository interfaces (e.g., `ECommerceRepositoryImpl`)

## Data Flow

### User Interaction
1. The user interacts with the UI (e.g., taps a button to view products).
2. The UI sends an event to the relevant Use Case in the Domain Layer.

### Data Retrieval
1. The Use Case processes the request and interacts with the repository interface to fetch data.
2. The repository implementation in the Data Layer fetches data from the appropriate data source (e.g., API, local database).
3. The fetched data is returned to the Use Case.

### Data Manipulation
1. The Use Case processes the data (e.g., filtering, sorting) and returns the results to the Presentation Layer.
2. The Presentation Layer updates the UI to reflect the changes based on the user interactions and data retrieved.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd e_commerce_app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies.
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the application.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Testing
The E-Commerce App includes unit tests for the Use Cases, Models, and other critical components. To run the tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Conclusion
The E-Commerce App is structured to provide a clean and maintainable codebase. By following the clean architecture principles, the app ensures separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and extend in the future.
